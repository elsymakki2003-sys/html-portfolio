<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an Electric Engineer who got bored and decided to give development a chance, and it 
  was quite the journey. I think I'm in love with what I'm doing. I hope this life choice goes well.

<p>
  Graduating from the American University of Beirut with a full scholarship 
  is one of my biggest accomplishments, never in my life did I ever imagine that I would be chosen
  to be one of the only 3 female engineers who get to study at the most prestigious university in Lebanon. But now,
  I have another accomplishment and it's learning to be a full stack engineer and a cybersecurity engineer on my own! 
  Not to be a show off but damn this was hard and incredible, not only do I create the most wonderful websites but also 
  I make them the most secure. You can think of me as a super hero.

<p>If you're deciding if you want to choose me or not. Just pick me already.
I know you want to.
